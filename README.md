thanks to https://github.com/truedread/netflix-1080p

My modified version can only work on Windows 10 64-bit, MicrosoftEdge(Chromium core)

It allows you to enjoy the highest 4K (before V79 version), and DDplus audio, if you are using a version after V79, then you get the same video as Chrome (min 540P max 1080P), but you can still enjoy DDplus audio.

and i have opened all languages (audio and sub,if any)
